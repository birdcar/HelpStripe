# Context Map: helpstripe

**Phase**: 6
**Scout Confidence**: 94/100
**Verdict**: GO

> Phase 6 (Automation Rules) ran inline scout (same read-only workflow). feat-006 depends on feat-003 (done). All prior phase sections retained below; Phase 6 findings added directly under this header.

## Phase 6 Findings (Automation Rules)

**Verdict GO (94/100).** Every file in the spec is identified; the engine reuses the Phase 2 action classes (CreateRequest/AddNote/AssignRequest/ChangeStatus), the Phase 8 SLA scopes (scopeSlaBreached/scopeSlaOverdue), the existing domain events, and established conventions (JSON casts, value objects, query objects, page SFCs). The `manage automation` permission ALREADY EXISTS (PermissionSeeder line 32, on Administrator).

### Dimensions (Phase 6)

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope clarity | 19/20 | All files identified. Engine API specified (`ConditionEvaluator::matches`, `Condition::fromArray`, `cause` label for activitylog). Open Q: exact activitylog causedBy mechanism — resolved during build. |
| Pattern familiarity | 19/20 | Action classes, events, listener (SendPublicReplyEmail), DTO (InboundEmail), JSON cast (Filter::criteria), value objects (UserTeam/CategoryReport), page SFC (teams ⚡edit/⚡index), command (ReplayInboundMail) all read. |
| Dependency awareness | 19/20 | applyMailRules seam in ProcessInboundEmail:154 is a no-op pass-through. Events have existing listeners (SendPublicReplyEmail on NoteAdded) — adding EvaluateTriggers is additive. AssignRequest/RequestAssignedNotification already accept null actor "for Phase 6 automation". |
| Edge case coverage | 18/20 | Loop guard (applying-context), empty actions, deleted category in action, malformed JSON hydration, idempotence-by-design, reply-bypasses-mail-rules, position ordering (later wins). |
| Test strategy | 19/20 | Pest feature tests under tests/Feature/Automation/. ConditionEvaluator pure-logic; travel() frozen time for scheduled; Event::fake (explicit lists — Request::boot needs creating); existing ActionsTest is the action-through-event template. |

### Key Patterns (Phase 6)

- `app/Jobs/ProcessInboundEmail.php:60-66,149-157` — the `applyMailRules(InboundEmail $email): InboundEmail` seam. Currently `return $email;`. Phase 6 fills it: run active mail-layer rules in position order, accumulating category/urgent/assignee OVERRIDES that the new-request branch (lines 106-117) folds into the `CreateRequest` payload. Mail rules act on the email *before* matching; replies (existing request, lines 89-105) bypass rules per HelpSpot.
- `app/Models/Request.php:227-321` — `scopeSlaBreached()`/`scopeSlaOverdue()` are the SINGLE SLA source of truth (Phase 8). Any SLA condition in the automation engine MUST call these scopes, never re-derive. They're query scopes (return void, mutate Builder), usable as `Request::query()->slaBreached()` / `->slaOverdue()`.
- `app/Actions/Requests/{CreateRequest,AddNote,AssignRequest,ChangeStatus}.php` — ActionApplier executes effects through THESE, never writing models directly, so activitylog + events + first_responded_at bookkeeping stay correct. AssignRequest::handle(Request, ?User assignee, ?User actor=null) — automation passes actor=null (notification still fires to assignee). ChangeStatus owns resolved_at + RequestStatusChanged. AddNote(Request, User|Customer, body, isPrivate, source, messageId, attachments).
- `app/Listeners/SendPublicReplyEmail.php` — the queued-listener template: `implements ShouldQueue`, `use InteractsWithQueue`, type-hinted `handle(NoteAdded $event)` (auto-discovery by type-hint — NO manual registration; confirmed no EventServiceProvider listen() array). EvaluateTriggers mirrors this, listening to RequestCreated/RequestStatusChanged/NoteAdded.
- `app/Support/Resend/InboundEmail.php` — DTO with a static `fromResend()` factory + readonly promoted constructor props + private parse helpers. Condition/Action value objects follow this: `final` class, readonly props, static `fromArray()`, throw `InvalidArgumentException` on malformed input (the engine catches per-rule + logs + skips).
- `app/Models/Filter.php:65-71` — the JSON cast pattern: `'criteria' => 'array'` in `casts()`. AutomationRule casts `conditions`/`actions` to `'array'` the same way; the model exposes accessors that hydrate the arrays into Condition[]/Action[] value objects (casts → value object mapping, taught without a library).
- `app/Data/{UserTeam,CategoryReport,AgentReport}.php` — readonly value-object precedent in `App\Data\`. But the spec puts the engine VOs under `app/Support/Automation/` (Condition/Action); follow the spec's location — they're engine-internal, alongside RuleEngine/ConditionEvaluator/ActionApplier, not report DTOs.
- `app/Console/Commands/ReplayInboundMail.php` — artisan command template (signature, handle, $this->info). RunAutomationRules (`automation:run`) mirrors it.
- `app/Notifications/RequestAssignedNotification.php` — `Notification implements ShouldQueue`, `use Queueable`, constructor promotion, `via()=['database','mail']`, `toMail()` MailMessage, `toArray()`. AutomationNotification follows this exactly ("Rule X fired on Request #N").
- `resources/views/pages/teams/⚡edit.blade.php` + `⚡index.blade.php` — page SFC anatomy: `mount(Model)` route-model bind + `Gate::authorize`, `#[Computed]`, action methods resolving deps as args, `Flux::toast`, inline `<flux:modal :show="$errors->isNotEmpty()">`, repeater rows of `@foreach`, `flux:select`/`flux:select.option`, `data-test` attrs. The rule builder's condition/action rows are array-prop repeaters with add/remove methods (mirrors how members are listed). NOTE: the index here uses route-model-bound CRUD gated by `can:manage knowledge base` (routes/web.php:90-94) — automation routes mirror that with `can:manage automation`.
- `resources/views/pages/reports/⚡index.blade.php` — `#[Url]` prop, `#[Computed]` delegating to query objects, `flux:select wire:model.live`, `flux:table`. Mirror for the automation index grouping + active toggle.
- `database/migrations/2026_06_10_140534_create_requests_table.php` — migration teaching-comment style: heavy `//` annotations, `$table->foreignId('team_id')->constrained()`, composite `$table->index([...])`. The automation_rules migration follows it (spec gives the exact schema).

### Dependencies (Phase 6)

- `app/Jobs/ProcessInboundEmail.php` — `applyMailRules()` filled in place; the new-request branch consumes accumulated overrides. Consumed by Inbox tests (InboundMatchingTest/InboundWebhookTest/InboundAttachmentTest) — mail-rule changes must keep the no-rule path identical (no rules → email passes through unchanged → existing tests green).
- `routes/console.php` — currently only the `inspire` command. Gains `Schedule::command('automation:run')->everyFiveMinutes()`. Schedule facade import needed.
- `routes/web.php` — automation routes go in the `{current_team}` group behind `can:manage automation` (mirror the KB/reports `Route::middleware('can:...')->group`).
- `resources/views/layouts/app/sidebar.blade.php` — add `@can('manage automation')` nav item (mirror the `@can('view reports')` / `@can('manage knowledge base')` blocks).
- `composer.json` dev script — add `php artisan schedule:work` to the concurrently stack (alongside server/queue/logs/reverb/vite). Update `--names`.
- `database/seeders/DemoSeeder.php` — DemoSeederTest asserts EXACT counts of existing entities; seeding automation rules must be purely additive (new `seedAutomationRules($team, $categories, $staff)` appended in `run()`). Three rules: mail (billing→Billing category), trigger (new urgent→notify admin), scheduled (unanswered 24h→urgent).
- Events (RequestCreated/RequestStatusChanged/NoteAdded) — EvaluateTriggers is an additive listener; existing listeners (SendPublicReplyEmail on NoteAdded) unaffected.
- `database/seeders/PermissionSeeder.php` — NO change: `manage automation` is already present (line 32, on Administrator).

### Conventions (Phase 6)

- **Naming**: `app/Support/Automation/{RuleEngine,ConditionEvaluator,ActionApplier,Condition,Action}.php`; enums `app/Enums/{RuleLayer,ConditionField,ConditionOperator,RuleAction}.php` (string-backed, TitleCase cases, `label()` helper); `app/Listeners/EvaluateTriggers.php`; `app/Console/Commands/RunAutomationRules.php`; `app/Notifications/AutomationNotification.php`; model `app/Models/AutomationRule.php` + factory; views `resources/views/pages/automation/⚡{index,edit}.blade.php`; tests `tests/Feature/Automation/*Test.php`.
- **Loop guard**: ActionApplier sets a static flag (spec: `RuleEngine::$applying`) so EvaluateTriggers skips events emitted by automation itself. Single-level suppression — wrap apply in try/finally to reset the flag.
- **Activitylog causation**: ActionApplier takes a `cause` string label; activitylog's `activity()->...->log()` or the model's `LogsActivity` description. Reuse the existing LogsActivity on Request (logs status/assigned_to/category_id/is_urgent) — the ActionApplier routes through the Phase 2 actions which already update those columns, so the diff is logged automatically. The "what automated this" label needs a causer/description hook — resolve mechanism during build (likely `activity()->by(...)->withProperties(...)->log()` OR set a description via `tap`/event). Logged as an implementation note if non-obvious.
- **Testing**: Pest feature tests, `RefreshDatabase` (global), `Event::fake([...])` with EXPLICIT lists (bare fake breaks Request::boot creating), `Notification::fake()`, `Mail::fake()`, `$this->travelTo()`/`travel()` for time, `CarbonImmutable::setTestNow()`, factories with states, `data-test` attrs for DOM, `Livewire::test('pages::automation.index')`.

### Risks (Phase 6)

- **Trigger infinite loop**: a trigger whose action re-fires its own event (e.g. status-change trigger that changes status). Mitigation: `RuleEngine::$applying` context flag set by ActionApplier; EvaluateTriggers returns early when set. Single-level only (documented limitation). Dedicated test: automation-caused status change does NOT re-fire triggers.
- **Scheduled rule re-match**: a non-self-extinguishing condition re-fires every 5-min run. Mitigation: idempotence-by-design (the seeded "unanswered 24h AND not urgent → set urgent" can't re-match once urgent). Test: run twice → second run no-ops. Doc warning in builder UI.
- **Deleted entity in action**: `set_category` referencing a deleted category → skip that action, add a private note "automation action skipped", continue the rule (spec error-handling row). Test it.
- **Malformed rule JSON**: hand-edited conditions/actions that don't hydrate → value-object `fromArray` throws → engine catches per-rule, skips + logs, continues. Test with a bad shape.
- **Field/subject mismatch**: `age_hours` condition on the mail layer (InboundEmail has no age) → evaluator returns false (non-match), debug log. Builder UI filters fields per layer. ConditionEvaluator resolves fields differently per subject type (Request vs InboundEmail).
- **Mail-rule order sensitivity**: two rules touching the same field → later (higher position) wins because actions accumulate into the payload in position order. Test + documented.
- **Inbox-test regression**: filling applyMailRules must leave the no-rules path byte-identical. Run `--filter=Inbox` after the mail-rule change.
- **Event::fake in trigger tests**: bare `Event::fake()` fakes Eloquent model events and breaks access-key generation (ActionsTest header documents this). Always pass an explicit event-class list, OR let events fire for real and assert side effects (the listener actually running through the queue:sync).

> Phase 4 (Self-Service Portal) ran inline scout (same read-only workflow). feat-004 depends on feat-003 (done). Phase 5 already shipped `layouts/portal.blade.php` + the `portal` route group — Phase 4 EXTENDS both. Phase 4 findings added below; all prior phase sections retained.

## Phase 4 Findings (Self-Service Portal)

**Verdict GO (92/100).** Every file is identified; the portal half is already partly built (KB pages + layout + route group), the email/access-key auth model already exists (Phase 3), and `CreateRequest`/`AddNote`/`ChangeStatus` are the reused write-paths.

### Dimensions (Phase 4)

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope clarity | 19/20 | All files identified. Open Q: exact session-key + signed-route param shape — resolved during build. |
| Pattern familiarity | 19/20 | Portal layout, portal KB SFCs, register form, request ⚡show timeline markup all read. |
| Dependency awareness | 18/20 | `CreateRequest`/`AddNote`/`ChangeStatus` reused; route-group ordering constraint known. |
| Edge case coverage | 18/20 | Private-note leak, generic lookup error, signature tamper, reopen-on-reply, customer dedup, case-sensitive key. |
| Test strategy | 18/20 | HTTP/Livewire feature tests; `RefreshDatabase`; factories; portal KB tests are the template. |

### Key Patterns (Phase 4)

- `resources/views/layouts/portal.blade.php` — EXISTS (Phase 5). Brand header with `Route::has('portal.home')` + `Route::has('portal.kb.index')` guards. Phase 4 adds Submit/Check-status nav links (also `Route::has`-guarded so order stays flexible). Do NOT recreate.
- `resources/views/pages/portal/kb/⚡index.blade.php` + `⚡search.blade.php` — the portal SFC template: `new #[Layout('layouts::portal')] #[Title('…')] class extends Component`, `#[Computed]`, `#[Url]`, `wire:model`/`wire:submit`, `data-test` attrs, flux:input/flux:heading/flux:text/flux:link, zinc dark-mode classes. Portal pages use `layouts::portal`, NOT `layouts::app`.
- `resources/views/pages/auth/register.blade.php` — public form layout reference (plain `<form>` + flux:input + flux:button). Portal submit is a Livewire `wire:submit` form (not a POST controller) to match the portal SFC pattern.
- `app/Actions/Requests/CreateRequest.php` — `handle(Customer, string subject, string body, RequestSource, array attributes): Request`. Portal calls with `RequestSource::Portal`. Fires `RequestCreated`, makes opening note inside a transaction, derives `access_key` via `Request::boot()` creating hook (`Str::random(12)`).
- `app/Actions/Requests/AddNote.php` — `handle(Request, User|Customer author, string body, bool isPrivate, RequestSource source, ?string messageId, array attachments): Note`. Customer reply = Customer author + `RequestSource::Portal`, isPrivate false. Broadcasts NoteAdded (presence channel) — harmless on portal (no socket id).
- `app/Jobs/ProcessInboundEmail.php:107-131` — the canonical "new request → confirmation mail" sequence to mirror: `CreateRequest::handle(... source ...)` then `Mail::to($customer->email)->send(new NewRequestConfirmationMail($request))`. Portal does the same but with `RequestSource::Portal`.
- `app/Jobs/ProcessInboundEmail.php:100-105` — reopen logic: customer reply to Resolved/Closed → `ChangeStatus::handle($request, RequestStatus::Active)`. Portal customer reply mirrors this exactly.
- `app/Mail/NewRequestConfirmationMail.php` + `resources/views/mail/new-request-confirmation.blade.php` — carries `$request->id` + `$request->access_key`. Already built (Phase 3). The page shows the request NUMBER only; the access key rides the email.
- `resources/views/pages/requests/⚡show.blade.php:527-562` — timeline note markup (customer vs staff vs private). Portal status timeline renders ONLY `is_private = false` notes — private notes must never appear (dedicated leak test).
- `App\Models\Customer` — `firstOrCreate`/dedup by lowercased email (mirror RequestController::resolveCustomer + ProcessInboundEmail). No user account.
- `App\Http\Requests\Api\StoreRequestRequest::installationTeam()` — `Team::query()->orderBy('id')->first()`. The portal has no tenant context either → lands requests on the installation team, same fallback.

### Dependencies (Phase 4)

- `routes/web.php` — the `portal` group (currently KB-only) gains home/submit/lookup/status routes. MUST stay before `{current_team}`. Throttle `throttle:10,1` on submit + lookup. Status route gets `signed` middleware on its signed-link variant.
- `resources/views/welcome.blade.php` — add a portal link (demos start at `/`). It's the framework starter welcome page (no Flux).
- `database/seeders/DemoSeeder.php` — `seedRequests()` already creates Portal-source requests. Add: print one seeded request's `access_key` + customer email to seeder output (`$this->command->info(...)`) for demo convenience.
- `App\Actions\Requests\CreateRequest` — no change needed (portal passes `RequestSource::Portal`); the portal component sends the confirmation mail itself, exactly like ProcessInboundEmail does. (Spec's "Modified Files" lists CreateRequest, but the mail-send belongs in the portal component to match the existing email-pipeline split where the JOB sends the mail, not the action. Logged as an implementation note.)

### Conventions (Phase 4)

- **Naming**: portal SFCs at `resources/views/pages/portal/⚡{home,submit,lookup,status}.blade.php`. Tests at `tests/Feature/Portal/{SubmitRequest,Lookup,CustomerReply}Test.php`.
- **Layout**: `#[Layout('layouts::portal')]` on every portal page component.
- **Routes**: `Route::livewire('…', 'pages::portal.{name}')->name('…')` inside the `portal.` group.
- **Tests**: Pest feature tests, `RefreshDatabase` (global in Pest.php), `$this->get(route(...))`, `Livewire::test(...)` for component flows, `Mail::fake()` + `Mail::assertQueued/assertSent`, `Customer::factory()`, `Team::factory()`.

### Risks (Phase 4)

- **Private-note leak** — the status timeline must filter `is_private = false`. Dedicated test asserting a private note's body is absent from rendered HTML (spec Failure Mode).
- **Route-group ordering** — portal routes must precede `{current_team}` (already true; new routes go inside the existing group).
- **Signed URL + session** — `URL::signedRoute('portal.status', ['request' => $id])` + `signed` middleware on that path; manual lookup sets a session key (`portal.verified.{id}`) so the reply box doesn't re-prompt. Generic "no match" error on failed lookup (no enumeration).
- **Throttle test** — hitting the 11th submit/lookup in a minute → 429. Tests may need to clear the rate limiter between cases or assert within one test.

## Phase 8 Header (superseded — see top)

**Phase**: 8
**Scout Confidence**: 90/100
**Verdict**: GO

> Note: Scout ran inline (no Agent subagent tool available in this environment); same workflow, same read-only exploration. Phase 1–2–3–5–7 sections retained below; Phase 8 findings added. (feat-008 Reporting depends only on feat-002, which is done.)

## Phase 8 Findings (Reporting)

**Verdict GO (90/100).** Every file in the spec is identified and the codebase has clear analogues for each.

### Key Patterns (Phase 8)

- `app/Queries/RequestQueue.php` — the query-object pattern to replicate. Plain class, `apply(Builder, array, ?User): Builder`, teaching docblock explaining *why* a query object (shared vocabulary across consumers). Phase 8 query classes take `(Team $team, CarbonImmutable $from, CarbonImmutable $to)` in the constructor and expose one public method returning shaped arrays/collections.
- `app/Models/Request.php` — gains `scopeSlaBreached()` / `scopeSlaOverdue()`. Existing `#[Scope]`-style is on KB models (`#[Scope] protected function published(Builder $query): void`) — Laravel 13 attribute scopes. SLA target lives on `category.sla_first_response_minutes` (nullable). Breach = `first_responded_at - created_at > sla` OR (unanswered AND `now - created_at > sla`). `>` not `>=` (boundary not a breach — documented).
- `database/factories/RequestFactory.php` — `aged(CarbonImmutable $from, $until)` and `withFirstResponse(int $minutes)` states are PURPOSE-BUILT for reporting tests: freeze clock, build requests at known offsets, assert exact aggregates. Category SLA targets via `Category::factory()->create(['sla_first_response_minutes' => 60])`.
- `resources/views/pages/requests/⚡index.blade.php` — page SFC anatomy to mirror: `new #[Title] class extends Component`, `#[Url]` props, `#[Computed]` getters delegating to query classes, `flux:select` for the range switcher, `flux:table`/`flux:table.columns`/`flux:table.rows`, `data-test` attributes, team-scoped via `Auth::user()->current_team_id`.
- Flux chart (Boost-verified 2026-06-10, flux-pro 2.x): `<flux:chart wire:model="data" class="aspect-[3/1]">` wraps `<flux:chart.svg>` containing `<flux:chart.line field="created" curve="none" />`, `<flux:chart.area>`, and `<flux:chart.axis axis="x" field="date">` / `<flux:chart.axis axis="y">`. `wire:model` binds a Livewire array property whose rows are assoc arrays: `[['date' => '2026-05-12', 'created' => 3, 'resolved' => 1], ...]`. Multiple `<flux:chart.line>` for created-vs-resolved. Legend needs `<flux:chart.viewport>` wrapper. x-axis auto-detects date scale.
- `database/seeders/PermissionSeeder.php` — `'view reports'` permission ALREADY EXISTS (line 32) and is on the Administrator role. The `can:view reports` middleware works through the Gate. No seeder change needed for the permission itself.
- `database/seeders/DemoSeeder.php` — already produces a non-degenerate dataset for charts: `firstResponseMinutes()` alternates inside-SLA (`target/2`) vs breach (`target*3`); all 3 categories cycle; requests spread over 60 days; staff assignment cycles (`$i % 4`, every 4th unassigned). Likely needs NO change — verify all 3 non-admin staff get assigned requests and there are both breaches and in-SLA per category.
- `tests/Feature/KnowledgeBase/AdminCrudTest.php` — the permission-gate test helper to mirror: `kbStaffer(bool $administrator)` seeds PermissionSeeder, creates team+user+membership, `assignRole('Administrator'|'Help Desk Staff')`. Reports tests need the same helper for the 403/nav-hidden assertions.

### Dependencies (Phase 8)

- `app/Models/Request.php` — adding scopes is additive (consumed by Foundation tests, DemoSeeder, factories, RequestQueue, all phases). `scopeSlaBreached` must JOIN/whereHas against category for the SLA target; `category_id` is nullable and `sla_first_response_minutes` is nullable → requests with no SLA target are NOT breaches (excluded from breach math but counted in totals).
- `routes/web.php` — new `reports` route goes inside the existing `{current_team}` group with `can:view reports` middleware, mirroring the `can:manage knowledge base` group already there. `Route::livewire('reports', 'pages::reports.index')->name('reports.index')`.
- `resources/views/layouts/app/sidebar.blade.php` — add `@can('view reports')`-gated nav item after the KB item, mirroring the existing `@can('manage knowledge base')` block. Icon `chart-bar` or similar.
- `app/Queries/Reports/*` — new sub-namespace under the existing `app/Queries/` dir (created Phase 2). No external consumers yet (reports page is the only caller); unit-testable in isolation.

### Risks (Phase 8)

- **Timezone bucketing drift**: requests stored UTC; day buckets must group consistently. Use `CarbonPeriod` over `created_at->toDateString()` after a single ranged select (PHP-side grouping, SQLite-safe). Test with a 23:30 fixture to pin the boundary.
- **SLA definition drift**: the report breach count and Phase 6 automation MUST share `scopeSlaBreached`. Define once on the model; reports use the scope, never inline the comparison. Cross-reference in tour docs 06 + 08.
- **Division by zero / empty averages**: a category with all-unanswered requests has no first-response samples → avg is null → render "—" not 0. Guard in the query class (return null, view coalesces).
- **Range edges**: inclusive `from`, exclusive `to` (documented). Request created inside range but resolved outside counts created-only. Zero-fill every day in range via CarbonPeriod even with no requests.
- **Deleted/former staff**: users aren't soft-deleted; an assignee who left the team still has an id. Agent table left-joins tolerantly — but the spec's "(former staff)" case is unlikely in the seeded data. Keep the agent query iterating over current team members; assigned-to-nobody is the `unassigned` exclusion.
- **No `requests(created_at)` index**: spec says measure first, likely unnecessary at demo scale (40 rows). Skip the migration; note in tour doc.

> Note: Scout ran inline (no Agent subagent tool available in this environment); same workflow, same read-only exploration. Phase 1–2–3–5 sections retained below; Phase 7 findings added. (feat-007 Collision Detection depends only on feat-002, which is done.)

Open Item resolved: Livewire 4 echo listeners with an embedded channel variable (`request.{id}`) must be registered via `getListeners()` returning `"echo-presence:request.{$this->helpdeskRequest->id},here" => 'method'` (and `joining`/`leaving`/`NoteAdded`) — the static `#[On('echo-presence:request.{id},…')]` attribute form is for class-property interpolation; getListeners is the robust path for the bound `$helpdeskRequest`. Broadcasting is NOT yet installed (no config/broadcasting.php, no reverb in composer.lock, BROADCAST_CONNECTION=log) → `install:broadcasting --reverb` runs clean. |

First broadcast channel, first ShouldBroadcast event, first Echo/JS wiring in the repo — Laravel/Livewire conventions apply. app.js is EMPTY (0 bytes) — `import './echo'` is the first line. |

BROADCAST_CONNECTION currently `log` — tests run with broadcasting effectively inert unless faked; use Event::fake / Broadcast assertions. |

Live two-browser behavior is the manual matrix (tour doc). |

## Key Patterns

### Phase 7

- `resources/views/pages/requests/⚡show.blade.php` — the SFC to modify. `mount(Request $request)` binds the ticket to `public Request $helpdeskRequest` after `Gate::authorize('view', $request)`. `#[Computed] notes()` returns `$helpdeskRequest->timeline()->get()` — the timeline to refresh on a remote `NoteAdded` (`unset($this->notes)` then `$refresh`, mirroring how `addNote()` already does `unset($this->notes)`). Echo listeners attach via `getListeners()` (channel name embeds `$this->helpdeskRequest->id`). Viewer state is a public array prop mutated by here/joining/leaving handlers.
- `app/Events/NoteAdded.php` — plain event `__construct(public Note $note)`. Gains `implements ShouldBroadcast`, `use InteractsWithSockets`, `broadcastOn(): PresenceChannel` (`new PresenceChannel('request.'.$this->note->request_id)`), `broadcastWith(): array` = `['note_id' => $this->note->id]` ONLY, optional `broadcastWhen()`. `toOthers()` is invoked at dispatch site (or via InteractsWithSockets + the socket id Echo sets) — author's own page must NOT refresh.
- `app/Actions/Requests/AddNote.php` — `NoteAdded::dispatch($note)` is the single broadcast trigger. To exclude the author's own client, dispatch via `broadcast(new NoteAdded($note))->toOthers()` OR keep `NoteAdded::dispatch` and rely on the socket-id header. Note: the queued `SendPublicReplyEmail` listener already consumes NoteAdded — unaffected by ShouldBroadcast.
- `app/Concerns/HasTeams.php::belongsToTeam(Team $team): bool` + `Team::members()` — channel auth closure mirror of RequestPolicy: `$user->belongsToTeam($helpdeskRequest->team)`. Returns `['id'=>…, 'name'=>…]` (User has NO avatar/profile_photo column — avatar stack uses `<flux:avatar :name="…">` initials, same as the timeline already does).
- Livewire 4 echo listeners (Boost-verified 2026-06-10): `getListeners()` returns `["echo-presence:request.{$id},here" => 'syncHere', "echo-presence:request.{$id},joining" => 'addViewer', "echo-presence:request.{$id},leaving" => 'removeViewer', "echo-presence:request.{$id},NoteAdded" => 'refreshTimeline']`. `here` handler receives the full member array; joining/leaving receive a single member. Class-name event (NoteAdded) — no leading dot needed (that's only for `broadcastAs()` custom names).
- Reverb/Echo install (Boost-verified): `php artisan install:broadcasting --reverb` publishes config/broadcasting.php + config/reverb.php, adds REVERB_*/VITE_REVERB_* to .env(.example), wires `channels:` routing, and scaffolds resources/js/echo.js + installs laravel-echo/pusher-js. In this repo app.js is empty and bun is the pacakge manager (package.json has no echo deps yet) — verify the scaffold; may need `bun add laravel-echo pusher-js` + manual `import './echo'` in app.js.

### Phase 3

- `app/Actions/Requests/CreateRequest.php` — the single write-path for new requests: DB::transaction wrapping request + opening customer note, event dispatched after commit. Email/API channels call it with `source` + `$attributes` (gains `message_id` for the opening note).
- `app/Actions/Requests/AddNote.php` — `handle(Request, User|Customer $author, string $body, bool $isPrivate, RequestSource $source)`; customer replies pass Customer author + RequestSource::Email. Gains optional `$messageId` + `$attachments` (downloaded temp files).
- `app/Actions/Requests/ChangeStatus.php` — owns resolved_at lifecycle; the inbound reopen path MUST go through it (clears resolved_at, fires RequestStatusChanged).
- `app/Notifications/RequestAssignedNotification.php` — queued mail pattern: `implements ShouldQueue`, `use Queueable`, constructor promotion, teaching docblocks.
- Resend ground truth (verified 2026-06-10 against resend.com/docs): webhook `email.received` payload = `{type, created_at, data: {email_id, from, to[], cc, bcc, subject, message_id, attachments[meta]}}`; body/headers via `GET https://api.resend.com/emails/receiving/{id}` (`{html, text, headers{lowercased}, message_id, attachments[]}`); attachment binaries via `GET .../receiving/{id}/attachments` (`data[].{download_url, size, filename, content_type}`). Signature: svix headers (`svix-id`, `svix-timestamp`, `svix-signature` as space-separated `v1,<base64>` list), secret `whsec_<base64>`, HMAC-SHA256 over `"{id}.{timestamp}.{rawBody}"`.
- Laravel mail Headers: `new Headers(messageId: 'note-1@domain', references: ['prior@domain'])` — IDs without angle brackets; Symfony adds them. Inbound Resend message_ids arrive WITH brackets — normalize (strip `<>`) at the DTO.
- spatie/laravel-webhook-client: config `webhook-client.php` configs[] entry (name, signing_secret, signature_validator, webhook_profile, webhook_response, webhook_model, process_webhook_job); `Route::webhooks('webhooks/resend', 'resend')`; job extends `ProcessWebhookJob` with `$this->webhookCall->payload`. CSRF exemption via `$middleware->validateCsrfTokens(except:)` in bootstrap/app.php.
- spatie/laravel-medialibrary: model `implements HasMedia` + `use InteractsWithMedia`; `$note->addMedia($tmpPath)->usingFileName(...)->toMediaCollection('attachments')`; publish `create_media_table` migration.

### Phase 5

- `app/Models/Category.php` + `database/migrations/...create_categories_table.php` + `CategoryFactory` — the team-scoped model triple to replicate for KnowledgeBook: `#[Fillable]` attribute, `@property` docblocks, typed relation docblocks, teaching docblocks in migrations, factory with `fake()` + named states.
- `resources/views/pages/teams/⚡index.blade.php` — page SFC anatomy: `new #[Title] class extends Component`, `#[Computed]`, action methods resolving deps from container, `Flux::toast`, inline `<flux:modal name=… :show="$errors->isNotEmpty()">` + `flux:modal.trigger`, `data-test` attributes.
- `resources/views/pages/requests/⚡show.blade.php` — `mount(Model $param)` route-model binding + authorization in mount.
- `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` + `partials/head.blade.php` — layout component anatomy; portal layout mirrors this minus sidebar (`<x-layouts::…>` not needed: plain Blade layout with `{{ $slot }}`, `@fluxAppearance`/`@fluxScripts`, title via `$title`).
- `database/seeders/PermissionSeeder.php` — `manage knowledge base` permission + Administrator role already exist; `can:manage knowledge base` route middleware works through the Gate (spatie registers permissions as abilities).
- Livewire 4: portal pages opt out of the app layout with `#[Layout('layouts::portal')]`; default is `layouts::app`.
- Laravel 13 scopes: `#[Scope] protected function published(Builder $query): void` — first scopes in the app, establish the attribute style.
- Sluggable: `use HasSlug; getSlugOptions(): SlugOptions` → `SlugOptions::create()->generateSlugsFrom('name')->saveSlugsTo('slug')->extraScope(fn ($builder) => $builder->where('chapter_id', $this->chapter_id))`. Default behavior regenerates slug on source rename (spec wants this — old slug 404s).

### Phase 2

- `resources/views/pages/teams/⚡index.blade.php` — SFC page anatomy: `new #[Title('…')] class extends Component`, action methods resolve action classes from the container as method args, `#[Computed]` getters, `Flux::toast(variant:, text:)`, `$this->dispatch('close-modal', name: …)`, inline `<flux:modal name="…" :show="$errors->isNotEmpty()">` with `wire:submit` form, `data-test` attributes on interactive elements.
- `resources/views/pages/teams/⚡edit.blade.php` — `mount(Team $team)` route-model-bound page, `Gate::authorize('update', $model)`, nested standalone modal SFCs rendered as `<livewire:pages::teams.invite-member-modal :team="$teamModel" />` with `:key` when in loops, `render()` returning `$this->view()->title(…)`.
- `resources/views/pages/teams/⚡invite-member-modal.blade.php` — standalone modal SFC: public props set in `mount()`, validation in action, `$this->reset(...)`, `dispatch('close-modal')`, toast, the `<flux:modal>` is the root element. This is the analogue for `⚡save-filter-modal` (spec's `⚡create-team-modal` reference is stale).
- `app/Actions/Teams/CreateTeam.php` — action class: single `handle()` method, explicit types, `DB::transaction`, teaching docblock.
- `app/Notifications/Teams/TeamInvitation.php` — `Notification implements ShouldQueue`, `use Queueable`, constructor property promotion, `via()` array, `toMail()` MailMessage chain, `toArray()` for database channel.
- `app/Policies/TeamPolicy.php` — plain policy class, `belongsToTeam()` checks; policies auto-discovered (no manual registration found).
- `tests/Feature/Teams/TeamTest.php` — `Livewire::test('pages::teams.index')->set(...)->call(...)->assertHasErrors/assertSee` style.

### Phase 1 (retained)

- `app/Models/Team.php` — model conventions: `#[Fillable([...])]` attribute (not `$fillable` property), `@property` docblocks for all columns and `@property-read` for relations, `casts()` method (not `$casts` property), typed relation return docblocks (`@return HasMany<Membership, $this>`), `static::creating(...)` in `boot()` for derived attributes.
- `database/factories/TeamFactory.php` — factory conventions: `@extends Factory<Model>` docblock, `fake()` helper, named state methods returning `static`.
- `app/Enums/TeamRole.php` — enum conventions: string-backed, TitleCase cases, `label()` helper, `match($this)` for derived values.
- `tests/Feature/Teams/TeamTest.php` — Pest style: top-level `test('...', function () {...})`, factories, `$this->actingAs(...)`, `assertDatabaseHas`.
- `tests/Pest.php` — `RefreshDatabase` already applied to everything in `tests/Feature`.

## Dependencies

### Phase 7

- `app/Events/NoteAdded.php` — consumed by `SendPublicReplyEmail` listener (queued, fires on public staff reply). Adding `ShouldBroadcast` is additive: the listener path is unchanged; broadcasting is a parallel dispatch. With `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=log` (test default) the broadcast no-ops to the log channel — existing tests that add notes are unaffected unless they `Event::fake()` and then must account for NoteAdded being broadcastable.
- `app/Actions/Requests/AddNote.php` — consumed by ⚡show `addNote()`, ProcessInboundEmail (Phase 3), CreateRequest's opening note path, ActionsTest/ShowRequestTest/Inbox tests. If `toOthers()` is added at the dispatch site, it requires a current socket connection; in non-HTTP/queued contexts `toOthers()` is a safe no-op (no socket id) — broadcasts to everyone, which is correct for inbound email replies.
- `resources/views/pages/requests/⚡show.blade.php` — consumed by ShowRequestTest (`Livewire::test('pages::requests.show', ['request' => $request])`). New public `$viewers` prop + `getListeners()` + refresh handlers must not disturb existing mount/addNote/property-update assertions. The new `⚡viewers.blade.php` partial is rendered inside show.
- `resources/js/app.js` (empty) + `vite.config.js` (inputs list) — `import './echo'` added; echo.js is a new Vite-bundled entry (already in the app.js input, no vite.config change needed if imported from app.js). `bun run build` must regenerate the manifest or ViteException.
- `bootstrap/app.php` — `withRouting()` currently has web/api/commands/health; `install:broadcasting` adds `channels: __DIR__.'/../routes/channels.php'`. Verify it lands.
- `composer.json` `dev` script — concurrently stack (server, queue, logs, vite) gains a `reverb` process: `php artisan reverb:start`.

### Phase 3

- `app/Actions/Requests/AddNote.php` — consumed by `pages/requests/⚡show.blade.php` (reply box) and ActionsTest/ShowRequestTest; new params must be optional with defaults so existing call sites compile unchanged.
- `app/Events/NoteAdded.php` — gains its first listener (SendPublicReplyEmail). Every existing test that adds a public staff note will now render PublicReplyMail to the array transport inline (sync queue) — the mailable must tolerate `mailbox_id = null` (fall back to `config('mail.from')`).
- `database/seeders/DemoSeeder.php` — DemoSeederTest asserts `support@helpstripe.test` / `billing@helpstripe.test`; address derivation from `config('helpstripe.inbound_domain')` must default to `helpstripe.test`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` — gains `api:` routing (first API route) + CSRF exemption for `webhooks/*`.
- `composer.json` — +resend/resend-php, +spatie/laravel-webhook-client, +spatie/laravel-medialibrary (spec-approved).

### Phase 5

- `routes/web.php` — admin kb routes go inside the existing `{current_team}` group with extra `can:manage knowledge base` middleware; portal kb routes are a new top-level public group (`Route::prefix('portal')->name('portal.')`) — Phase 4 will add its own routes to a sibling/merged group later. `Route::has('portal.kb.index')` is the cross-phase guard Phase 4 consumes.
- `resources/views/layouts/portal.blade.php` — created here (minimal); Phase 4 spec lists it as its own new file → Phase 4 should treat it as existing and extend, not recreate (noted in implementation notes).
- `database/seeders/DemoSeeder.php` — `DemoSeederTest` asserts exact counts of existing entities; KB seeding must be purely additive. New `seedKnowledgeBase($team)` call appended in `run()`.
- `resources/views/layouts/app/sidebar.blade.php` — add `@can('manage knowledge base')`-gated item after Queue.
- Nested binding chain relies on relationship names matching route param plurals: `KnowledgeBook::chapters()`, `Chapter::pages()` — required by `scopeBindings()` convention (`{book:slug}/{chapter:slug}/{page:slug}` guesses `chapters`/`pages`).

### Phase 2

- `routes/web.php` — `{current_team}` prefix group with `['auth', 'verified', EnsureTeamMembership::class]` already exists; new routes append inside it. `Route::livewire(uri, 'pages::…')` is the established route style (see `routes/settings.php`).
- `resources/views/layouts/app/sidebar.blade.php` — Queue placeholder item (lines 21–24) currently points at `route('dashboard')`; consumed by all authed pages via the app layout. Change is a repoint + badge.
- `database/seeders/DemoSeeder.php` — consumed by `migrate:fresh --seed` and `DemoSeederTest` (asserts exact counts — adding Responses/Filters must not disturb existing counts).
- `app/Models/Request.php` — consumed by Foundation tests, DemoSeeder, factories. Adding scopes/helpers is additive.
- `app/Queries/`, `app/Events/`, `app/Actions/Requests/` — new directories; `app/Actions/Teams/` and `app/Notifications/Teams/` establish the parent-dir precedent (spec explicitly authorizes `app/Queries`).
- `EnsureTeamMembership` resolves the team from `{current_team}` or `{team}` route params and calls `switchTeam` → `URL::defaults(['current_team' => slug])`, so `route('requests.index')` works without explicit slug after middleware runs; tests must pass `['current_team' => $team->slug]` explicitly.

### Phase 1 (retained)

- `app/Models/User.php` — consumed by auth flows, `HasTeams` concern, Fortify actions, Livewire components, `UserFactory`.
- `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` — uses `WithoutModelEvents`; DemoSeeder must NOT use that trait.

## Conventions

- **Naming**: models singular TitleCase; actions verb-first (`CreateTeam`); notifications `{Thing}Notification` or domain-grouped dirs; tests `{Thing}Test.php` under `tests/Feature/{Domain}/`; SFC pages under `resources/views/pages/{domain}/⚡{name}.blade.php`.
- **Imports**: fully-qualified `use` statements, alphabetized (Pint-enforced); `App\Models\Request` collides with `Illuminate\Http\Request` — alias the framework class (`use Illuminate\Http\Request as HttpRequest;`) where both are needed; inside `App\Models`, bare `Request::class` resolves to the model.
- **Attributes over properties**: `#[Fillable]`, `#[Hidden]` PHP attributes (Laravel 13 starter style).
- **Types**: explicit return types everywhere; generics in docblocks; larastan enforced via `composer test`.
- **Testing**: Pest 4, `test()` functions, feature tests by default, `RefreshDatabase` global for Feature dir, `fake()` helper, `Livewire::test('pages::…')` for SFC pages, `data-test` attributes for DOM assertions.
- **Teaching comments**: this repo explicitly wants teaching docblocks at point of use.
- **Status presentation**: `RequestStatus::color()` returns Flux badge colors — use `<flux:badge :color="$status->color()">`.
- **Activity history**: activitylog v5 — diffs in `Activity::attribute_changes` (`['attributes' => [...], 'old' => [...]]`), logged fields: status, assigned_to, category_id, is_urgent.

## Risks

### Phase 7

- **install:broadcasting interactivity**: the command may prompt (Reverb install, npm vs bun). Pass `--reverb --no-interaction`; if it tries `npm install`, it may add laravel-echo/pusher-js to package.json but run the wrong package manager — re-run `bun install` / `bun add laravel-echo pusher-js` and verify package.json. The scaffolded `resources/js/echo.js` may overwrite or expect an import in app.js (currently empty).
- **toOthers() in test context**: `broadcast(...)->toOthers()` reads the `X-Socket-ID` header; absent in Pest/queued runs → broadcasts to all (harmless). BroadcastTest should assert the event implements ShouldBroadcast + channel/payload shape via `Event::fake()` + `assertDispatched`, NOT assert toOthers filtering (that's a connection-time concern).
- **Channel auth test path**: hitting `POST /broadcasting/auth` requires the `channels:` route registered + a presence channel name + authenticated session. Simpler/robust: resolve the closure from `routes/channels.php` directly, or use Laravel's channel testing. The auth callback receives the route-model-bound `Request $helpdeskRequest` — binding a non-existent id 404s (graceful). Foreign-team member → closure returns false → 403; guest → guard denies before closure runs.
- **Payload-shape regression guard**: spec FAILURE MODE — a future dev fattening `broadcastWith` to include the note body would leak private-note text over the websocket. The BroadcastTest payload-shape assertion (`note_id` only) is the pin; keep it strict.
- **app.js empty**: `import './echo'` is the entire file's first content; passkeys.js is a separate vite input and must not be touched.
- **User has no avatar column**: viewer banner avatars use `<flux:avatar :name="$viewer['name']">` (initials), consistent with the existing timeline rendering — do not invent an avatar URL field in the channel_data payload.

### Phase 3

- **Spec payload-shape divergence (resolved)**: spec pseudocode assumed body/headers inline in the webhook payload; reality is a two-step fetch. `InboundEmail` DTO becomes the single parse point over (webhook payload + retrieved email JSON); fixtures bundle both parts per scenario.
- New listener fires in all existing AddNote tests — if any existing test asserts exact mail counts via the array transport it could break (none found, but watch ShowRequestTest).
- `mail:replay` must not hit the network: command `Http::fake()`s the Resend content/attachment endpoints from the fixture before running the job.
- Note XOR authorship invariant: "attachment could not be imported" private note needs an author — no system user exists; customer-authored private note chosen (logged in implementation notes).
- Package compatibility with Laravel 13 unverified until `composer require` runs (webhook-client, medialibrary).

### Phase 5

- Route param `{page}` (Page model) coexists with Livewire pagination's `page` query param — distinct (path segment vs query string) but worth a comment; avoid `WithPagination` on the portal page component.
- Implicit binding ignores published state — portal mount() must 404 drafts explicitly (`abort_unless($book->is_published, 404)` etc.); binding only proves hierarchy, not visibility.
- `App\Models\Page` is a generic name — no collision today (`Flux\Page`? no), but keep imports explicit.
- spatie/laravel-sluggable is a new dependency — spec-approved via composer.json entry; verify version supports `extraScope` (v3.7+).
- Permission middleware via `can:` uses the Gate; tests must seed PermissionSeeder before `assignRole('Administrator')`/`givePermissionTo` and may need `PermissionRegistrar` cache reset (seeder handles it).
- DemoSeeder KB content includes the searchable "password" page (spec demo: search "password" finds the published page, excludes a draft twin) — keep titles deterministic.

### Phase 2

- Route param named `{request}` shadows the conventional HTTP request name — fine in Livewire `mount(Request $request)` (model binding via `App\Models\Request` type-hint), but any closure/controller also needing the HTTP request must alias it.
- `DemoSeederTest` asserts exact dataset counts — seeding Responses/Filters must be purely additive; re-check that test after seeder changes.
- Queue page combines `#[Url]` filter props with `WithPagination` (also URL-tracked) — filter changes must call `$this->resetPage()` or stale page numbers return empty pages.
- `RequestAssignedNotification` is `ShouldQueue` — local demo needs `composer run dev` (queue:listen) for mail; database channel rows are written when the queued job is processed. Tour doc demo script must start the queue.
- Saved Filter criteria JSON may carry unknown keys from later phases — `RequestQueue::apply()` must ignore unknown keys (spec failure mode; covered by FilterTest legacy-shape test).
- Activity rows for `assigned_to`/`category_id` store raw IDs — History tab must resolve IDs to names without N+1 (pre-load users/categories maps).

### Phase 1 (retained)

- `App\Models\Request` vs `Illuminate\Http\Request` collision — deliberate; PHPStan catches wrong resolution.
- Spatie permission caches roles/permissions — seeder resets cache before creating permissions.
- Time-dependent demo data: tests freeze time; factory `aged` state takes explicit ranges.
